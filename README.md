# [Developer's Guide to AWS Costs](https://developer-cost-guide.projects.macroscope.io/)



## Introduction

Engineers are spending too much time and money trying to understand and control their AWS Cloud Costs. The Developer's Guide to AWS Costs is a set of guides that share code with Engineers who are working on AWS Cost Analysis to enable quick billing analysis to find cost drivers.

## Guides

The information on the [Developer's Guide to AWS Costs](https://getstrake.com/blog) website is structured in 'Guides'. Each guide will give a user a start-to-finish overview of how to perform analysis on an AWS Service. Guides include details on IAM Permissions (when required), sample code for analysis, and in-depth explanations of query results and the Cost and Usage Report (CUR) fields required for analysis.
